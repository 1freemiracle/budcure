# The Cannaster
## super convenient way to get nugs to the perfect moisture content for canning
The Cannaster simply uses a pressure sensor (bme280) to control a small vacuum pump, keeeping it at a certain pressure for a certain amount of time. The humidity sensors will be two point calibrated.
### the actual program for the Cannaster is to just turn on the pump if the humidity level rises above a certain level, and you can also do one where it'll turn on for a certain time then off again(for fast drying).
