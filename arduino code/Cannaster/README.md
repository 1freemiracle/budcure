# The Cannaster
## Super convenient way to get nugs to the perfect moisture content for canning
The Cannaster simply uses a combination breakout board of AHT20 moisture sensor with the pressure sensor (BMP280) to give us precise readings on moisture and also track the pressure inside the chamber on one 2$ board. Its other job is to operate the stepper motors using a L293D motor driver. For this task I am using the Arduino Nano as the controller. 
### The Cannaster can be set to turn on the pump over specified intervals, or there is the option to turn it on based on the humidity levels. The main problem that is being avoided is the growth of mold, which means the bud must be destroyed as there is no safe level of contamination (unless you eat it? But not smoking it!)
