# The BudCure Box program files (Arduino IDE)
## The BudCure uses two mosfets to switch the thermoelectric device `TEC` and the exauhst fan. It reads from two sensors, one is a temp sensor (`one wire` dallas temp sensor) plugged into the TEC, and a DHT22 temp/humidity sensor. I'm able to control the temperature of the TEC to condense the water vapor out, drying the plant material. There is also a fan to help conserve energy ( the TEC runs about 2.5 amps) while the buds are waiting to become dry enough to close the exaust fan lid and use the TEC, for a controlled drying. 
Some issues that have arrisen include the Nano doesn't have enough buffer memory to run an OLED array all at once, in effect I had to use an alternative OLED library that will want to flicker the screen when you update the sensor readings. The weight system uses a 1kg load cell hooked up to an HX711. A problem has arisen that the scale isn't exactly precisly tracking the lose of water vapor, at least at the 5 gram level, the exact number seems to not be reliable.
