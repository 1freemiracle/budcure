# The BudCure Box program files (Arduino IDE)
## The BudCure uses two mosfets to switch the thermoelectric device `TEC` and the exauhst fan. It reads from two sensors, one is a temperature probe (one wire 'dallas temperature sensor') plugged into the TEC, and a 'DHT22' temp/humidity sensor. I'm using a 'WEMOS D1 MINI' for the processor, using every pin except A0 (the single analog pin). I'm using interrupts to manage the rotary encoder with integrated pushbutton. Memory is also used to record various data.
To make the load cell more accurate (due to drift of the readings) I implimented a scheme where you remove the tray to tare out the drift and then replace the tray to get the correct weight readings. 
### The actual program uses the TEC whenever the humidity is above a certain percentage. You can also choose between using the fan to dry the buds (turns on at regular intervals and/or at a certain humidity level) or using the TEC (which consumes 2.5 amps). The idea is that you first dry with the fan, then use the TEC to provide a controlled enviornment (so they dry slowly in a controlled enviornment). There is one requirment: to avoid frost. I have tweeked around with the dew point formula to keep the TEC at the dew point, still testing. . . You can also calibrate the load cell, and TARE to zero the scale from inside the menu.
