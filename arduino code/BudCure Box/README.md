# The BudCure Box program files (Arduino IDE)
## The BudCure uses two mosfets to switch the thermoelectric device `TEC` and the exauhst fan. It reads from two sensors, one is a temperature probe (one wire 'dallas temperature sensor') plugged into the TEC, and a 'DHT22' temp/humidity sensor. I'm using a 'WEMOS D1 MINI' for the processor, using every pin except A0 (the single analog pin). I'm using interrupts to manage the rotary encoder with integrated pushbutton. Memory is also used to record various data.
To make the load cell more accurate (due to drift of the readings) I implimented a scheme where you remove the tray to tare out the drift and then replace the tray to get the correct weight readings. 
### Using the OLED display and the rotary encoder you can scroll through several options. You start with calibrating the scale (without the tray attached) with the calibrate option. That option puts in the weight of the tray into memmory. You would then load up the tray with plant material and then use option "new weight" to record the starting initial wieght into memmory. Then you would turn on either the fan or the TEC to keep the humidity down. As the material dries you keep recording new weights to track moisture loss.
