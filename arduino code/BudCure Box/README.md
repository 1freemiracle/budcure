# The BudCure Box program files (Arduino IDE)
## The BudCure uses two mosfets to switch the thermoelectric device `TEC` and the exauhst fan. It reads from two sensors, one is a temp sensor (`one wire` dallas temp sensor) plugged into the TEC, and a DHT22 temp/humidity sensor. I'm able to control the temperature of the TEC to condense the water vapor out, drying the plant material. There is also a fan to help conserve energy ( the TEC runs about 2.5 amps) while the buds are waiting to become dry enough to close the exaust fan lid and use the TEC, for a controlled drying.
