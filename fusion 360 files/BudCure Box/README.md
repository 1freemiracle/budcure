# The BudCure Box uses
##  laser cut panels and 3D printed parts. The box panels are held together with 3D printed slots bolted to the adjacent panel. One major design consideration is that the box has to be sealed from the outside humidity, so extra steps are taken to provide a sealed interior. The display is on the front door, and all the electronics are on the roof. The buds hang upside down from the load cell. There is a removable rack for loading the buds into the machine, I desgned some clips to hold the stems under spring pressure. It is designed to hold up to 1800 grams. 
Some design issues that have arrisen is that the rack is very sensitive, so all the wires above it had to be tied down. Also, the wires for the display limit the amount of travel of the door.
