The Cannaster is simple to build. The lid is the most complex part of the process, requiring a good enough seal to reach below 7psi. It has one port to accept 4 wires (to the i2c sensors) and a vacuum line. I have to use epoxy to seal the inside of the lid. A mold for pourable silicon is made from TPU filament, and that will be used to make a silicon gasket. The gasket will then be attached to the lid using silicon. The lid is driven by 4 stepper motors, turning a screw with just enough torque to push down the lid for a good enough seal to start pressurizing the pot. 

The pot (not shown in the picture) has an insert that helps keep the buds seperated.
