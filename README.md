# The BudCure is composed of two machines, the BudCure Box and the Cannaster. 
## In the BudCure Box, you can estimate the moisture content by the weight loss due to evaporation. The weight is tracked from harvest and a target weight is calculated. 
# The BudCure Box provides a stable enviornment for the buds to slowly dry. 
## The Cannaster takes mostly dry nugs and gets them to the perfect moisture content for canning. The intense vacuum brings moisture out from inside the nugs, drying them quickly and evenly to a precise moisture content.
