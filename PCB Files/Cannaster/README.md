# PCB files for the Cannaster
## 4 stepper motors plug directly into the board, with the L293D stepper driver chip. I'm also plugging into i2c humidity and pressure sensor, the BMP280 + AHT20, along with an OLED with rotary encoder display. Here an adjustble power supply is used to provide 5v to the Nano.
